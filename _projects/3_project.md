<p style="text-align: left; color: black; font-size:18px;font-weight:bold">Brief Description of the Project Concept</p> 
 The project focuses on advancing Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) systems by integrating cutting-edge technologies such as edge computing (EC), network slicing (NS), and artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML). This enables distributed intelligence in wireless networks, transforming them into low-power, high-efficiency computing systems capable of reasoning, inference, and near-zero latency decision-making. The project addresses challenges in handling exponential data traffic growth, tactile Internet requirements, and dynamic resource optimization.

<p style="text-align: left; color: black; font-size:18px;font-weight:bold">Specific Objectives of the Project:</p> 
* Develop a Multi-Layer Optimization Framework: Formalize a detailed framework and methodologies for joint computation and communication strategies within resilience-aware edge computing for O-RAN.

* Innovative Learning Algorithms: Create advanced AI/ML algorithms specifically designed for large-scale O-RAN systems to enhance their adaptability and efficiency.
  
* Novel Network Slicing Solutions: Design dynamic and scalable resource optimization techniques for network slicing, ensuring flexibility, efficiency, and scalability while addressing the shared O-RAN infrastructure challenges.

<p style="text-align: left; color: black; font-size:18px;font-weight:bold">Impacts:</p> 
This project will revolutionize wireless networks by enabling resilient, low-latency, and intelligent O-RAN systems to meet the demands of 6G and beyond. Technologically, it will enhance network adaptability and efficiency, enabling seamless performance under diverse conditions while supporting applications like the tactile Internet and smart traffic systems. Distributed intelligence will transform networks into powerful computational platforms, providing near-instantaneous decision-making capabilities.
