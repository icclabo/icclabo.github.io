  abstract={In this paper, we address a dynamic network resource selection problem for mobile users in a rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA)-enabled network by leveraging evolutionary games. Particularly, mobile users are able to locally and dynamically make their selection on orthogonal resource blocks (RBs), which are also considered as network resources (NRs), over time to achieve their desired utilities. Then, RSMA is used for each group of users selecting the same NR. With the use of RSMA, the main goal is to optimize the beamformers of the common and private messages for users in the same group to maximize their sum rate. The resulting problem is generally non-convex, and thus we develop a successive convex approximation (SCA)-based algorithm to efficiently solve it in an iterative fashion. To model the NR adaptation of users, we propose to use two evolutionary games, i.e . a traditional evolutionary game (TEG) and fractional evolutionary game (FEG). The FEG approach enables users to incorporate memory effects ( i.e . their past experiences) for their decision-making, which is more realistic than the TEG approach. We then theoretically verify the existence of the equilibrium of the proposed game approaches. Simulation results are provided to validate their consistency with the theoretical analysis and merits of the proposed approaches. They also reveal that, compared with TEG, FEG enables users to leverage past information for their decision-making, resulting in less communication overhead, while still guaranteeing convergence},

  abstract={Open radio access network (ORAN) Alliance offers a disaggregated RAN functionality built using open interface specifications between blocks. To efficiently support various competing services, namely enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) and ultra-reliable and low-latency (uRLLC), the ORAN Alliance has introduced a standard approach toward more virtualized, open, and intelligent networks. To realize the benefits of ORAN in optimizing resource utilization, this paper studies an intelligent traffic steering (TS) scheme within the proposed disaggregated ORAN architecture. For this purpose, we propose a joint intelligent traffic prediction, flow-split distribution, dynamic user association, and radio resource management (JIFDR) framework in the presence of unknown dynamic traffic demands. To adapt to dynamic environments on different time scales, we decompose the formulated optimization problem into two long-term and short-term subproblems, where the optimality of the latter is strongly dependent on the optimal dynamic traffic demand. We then apply a long-short-term memory (LSTM) model to effectively solve the long-term subproblem, aiming to predict dynamic traffic demands, RAN slicing, and flow-split decisions. The resulting non-convex short-term subproblem is converted to a more computationally tractable form by exploiting successive convex approximations. Finally, simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms compared to several well-known benchmark schemes},

abstract={Federated learning (FL) is capable of performing large distributed machine learning tasks across multiple edge users by periodically aggregating trained local parameters. To address key challenges of enabling FL over a wireless fog-cloud system (e.g., non-i.i.d. data, users’ heterogeneity), we first propose an efficient FL algorithm based on Federated Averaging (called FedFog ) to perform the local aggregation of gradient parameters at fog servers and global training update at the cloud. Next, we employ FedFog in wireless fog-cloud systems by investigating a novel network-aware FL optimization problem that strikes the balance between the global loss and completion time. An iterative algorithm is then developed to obtain a precise measurement of the system performance, which helps design an efficient stopping criteria to output an appropriate number of global rounds. To mitigate the straggler effect, we propose a flexible user aggregation strategy that trains fast users first to obtain a certain level of accuracy before allowing slow users to join the global training updates. Extensive numerical results using several real-world FL tasks are provided to verify the theoretical convergence of FedFog . We also show that the proposed co-design of FL and communication is essential to substantially improve resource utilization while achieving comparable accuracy of the learning model},

abstract={We consider a full-duplex (FD) multiuser system where an FD base station (BS) is designed to simultaneously serve both downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) users in the presence of half-duplex eavesdroppers (Eves). The problem is to maximize the minimum (max-min) secrecy rate (SR) among all legitimate users, where the information signals at the FD-BS are accompanied with artificial noise to debilitate the Eves' channels. To enhance the max-min SR, a major part of the power budget should be allocated to serve the users with poor channel qualities, such as those far from the FD-BS, undermining the SR for other users, and thus compromising the SR per-user. In addition, the main obstacle in designing an FD system is due to the self-interference (SI) and co-channel interference (CCI) among users. We therefore propose an alternative solution, where the FD-BS uses a fraction of the time block to serve near DL users and far UL users, and the remaining fractional time to serve other users. The proposed scheme mitigates the harmful effects of SI, CCI, and multiuser interference, and provides system robustness. The SR optimization problem has a highly nonconcave and nonsmooth objective, subject to nonconvex constraints. For the case of perfect channel state information (CSI), we develop a low-complexity path-following algorithm, which involves only a simple convex program of moderate dimension at each iteration. We show that our path-following algorithm guarantees convergence at least to a local optimum. Then, we extend the path-following algorithm to the cases of partially known Eves' CSI, where only statistics of CSI for the Eves are known, and worst-case scenario in which Eves can employ a more advanced linear decoder. The merit of our proposed approach is further demonstrated by extensive numerical results},

abstract={In-band full-duplex (FD) operation is practically more suited for short-range communications such as WiFi and small-cell networks, due to its current practical limitations on the self-interference cancellation. In addition, cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) is a new and scalable version of MIMO networks, which is designed to bring service antennas closer to end user equipments (UEs). To achieve higher spectral and energy efficiencies (SE-EE) of a wireless network, it is of practical interest to incorporate FD capability into CF-mMIMO systems to utilize their combined benefits. We formulate a novel and comprehensive optimization problem for the maximization of SE and EE in which power control, access point-UE (AP-UE) association and AP selection are jointly optimized under a realistic power consumption model, resulting in a difficult class of mixed-integer nonconvex programming. To tackle the binary nature of the formulated problem, we propose an efficient approach by exploiting a strong coupling between binary and continuous variables, leading to a more tractable problem. In this regard, two low-complexity transmission designs based on zero-forcing (ZF) are proposed. Combining tools from inner approximation framework and Dinkelbach method, we develop simple iterative algorithms with polynomial computational complexity in each iteration and strong theoretical performance guaranteed. Furthermore, towards a robust design for FD CF-mMIMO, a novel heap-based pilot assignment algorithm is proposed to mitigate effects of pilot contamination. Numerical results show that our proposed designs with realistic parameters significantly outperform the well-known approaches (i.e., small-cell and collocated mMIMO) in terms of the SE and EE. Notably, the proposed ZF designs require much less execution time than the simple maximum ratio transmission/combining.},
