ICCLab was founded in September 2022, when [Dr. Dinh Nguyen](https://vinuni.edu.vn/people/nguyen-van-dinh-phd/) joined the [College of Engineering Computer Science, VinUniversity](https://vinuni.edu.vn/college-of-engineering-computer-science/).

Our research interests are mainly on employing various applied mathematical tools (i.e., stochastic modeling, queueing theory and optimization theory) and machine learning techniques to design, analyze and optimize the cutting-edge applications in complex wire/wireless networks: fog/edge computing and data center, IoT networks, 5G/6G network resource allocations, and distributed machine learning for wireless networks.

<p style="text-align:left; color:black; font-size:18px;font-weight:bold">What is research? Why do we conduct it?</p> “*The heart and soul of good writing is research; you should write not what you know but what you can find out about*” (Robert J. Sawyer)

<p style="text-align: left; color: black; font-size:18px;font-weight:bold">Research interests</p> 
* Applied AI/ML techniques: IoT, 5G/6G
* Tasked-oriented communication
* Open radio access networks: fog/edge computing, slicing, traffic steering, load balancing
* Wireless sensing, wireless imaging

<p style="text-align: left; color: black; font-size:18px;font-weight:bold">Open positions:</p> We are looking for highly motivated and outstanding researchers in the area of wireless sensing/imaging, tasked-oriented/semantic communication, IoT, 5G/6G and applied AI/ML. We offer a high standard and flexible working environment  accompanied by a competitive salary package. Please send your CV to **dinh.nv2@vinuni.edu.vn** if interested:
* 2 Ph.D.scholarships in CS/EE (fully funded within 4 years)
* 2-3 full-time Research Assistants
