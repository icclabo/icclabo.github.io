ICC Lab was founded in September 2022, when [Prof. Dinh Nguyen](https://vinuni.edu.vn/people/nguyen-van-dinh-phd/) joined the [College of Engineering Computer Science, VinUniversity](https://vinuni.edu.vn/college-of-engineering-computer-science/).

Our research interests are mainly on employing various applied mathematical tools (i.e., stochastic modeling, queueing theory and optimization theory) and machine learning techniques to design, analyze and optimize the cutting-edge applications in complexed wire/wireless networks: fog/edge/quantum computing and data center, IoT networks, 5G network resource allocations, and distributed machine learning for wireless networks.

* Applied Machine Learning Techniques
* Fog/Edge/Quantum Computing
* Context-Aware Resource Allocation
* Internet of Things
* Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communications
* Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)
* Physical Layer Security
* Cognitive Radio Networks
* Full-Duplex Radios
* Open Radio Access Networks

## What is research? Why we conduct it?

“*The heart and soul of good writing is research; you should write not what you know but what you can find out about*” (Robert J. Sawyer)

## Team Members:
ICC Lab has two PhD students and three research assistants (RAs). We are currently looking for TWO PhD students and THREE RAs to join us in 2023 with attractive packages. Please send your CV to the PI (dinh.nv2@vinuni.edu.vn) if you are interested.
