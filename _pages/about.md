ICCLab was founded in September 2022, when [Dr. Dinh Nguyen](https://vinuni.edu.vn/people/nguyen-van-dinh-phd/) joined the [College of Engineering Computer Science, VinUniversity](https://vinuni.edu.vn/college-of-engineering-computer-science/).

Our research interests are mainly on employing various applied mathematical tools (i.e., stochastic modeling, queueing theory and optimization theory) and machine learning techniques to design, analyze and optimize the cutting-edge applications in complexed wire/wireless networks: fog/edge computing and data center, IoT networks, 5G/6G network resource allocations, and distributed machine learning for wireless networks.

<p style="text-align: left; color: black; font-size:18px;font-weight:bold">Research interests</p> 
* Applied AI/ML techniques: URLLC, UAV, PLS, CRN, FD, IoT, 5G/6G
* Fog/edge computing
* Open radio access networks
* Wireless sensing

<p style="text-align: left; color: black; font-size:18px;font-weight:bold">Open positions:</p> We are looking for a highly motivated and an outstanding researcher in the area of wireless sensing and applied AL. Please send your CV to dinh.nv2@vinuni.edu.vn if interested.
