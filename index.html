<p>ICC Lab was founded in September 2022, when <a href="https://vinuni.edu.vn/people/nguyen-van-dinh-phd/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Prof. Dinh Nguyen</a> joined the <a href="https://vinuni.edu.vn/college-of-engineering-computer-science/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">College of Engineering Computer Science, VinUniversity</a>.</p>

<p>Our research interests are mainly on employing various applied mathematical tools (i.e., stochastic modeling, queueing theory and optimization theory) and machine learning techniques to design, analyze and optimize the cutting-edge applications in complexed wire/wireless networks: fog/edge/quantum computing and data center, IoT networks, 5G network resource allocations, and distributed machine learning for wireless networks.</p>
